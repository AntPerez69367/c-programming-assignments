 * |       Language:  C 
 * |       Compile:   process.h must be in the directory
 * |                  gcc process.c process_funcs.c â€“o process
 * |           Run: ./process # (# must be an integer >= 0)
 * |         
 * |      To pipe input into ./convert and output to text file:
 * |                ./process < data.dat # | ./convert.dat > output.dat

 * |  
 * |  Description:  This program processes and validates each line to check for a 
 * |                valid date. If a valid date is found it prints it out, otherwise
 * |                the input is skipped. 
 * |                  
 * |        Input:  Command line argument supplied dictates how many valid dates need
 * |                to be processed. Input is taken from stdin and looks for a date
 * |                in the format of MM/DD/YYYY. Year can be from INT_MIN to INT_MAX. 
 * |  
 * |       Output:  The program will first output the # you put in the command line arg.
 * |                it will then output dates, after it has finished outputting dates it 
 * |                will out put "DONE" to indicate that it is finished processing.
 * |  
 * |      Process:  The program first checks the command line argument to know how much  
 * |                it needs to process. It then processes the stdin until it either reaches
 * |                the supplied count or reaches EOF.
